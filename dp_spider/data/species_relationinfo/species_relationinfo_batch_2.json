  "ManagementInfo": "Cultural Control and Sanitary Methods^p^pCrop rotation has a strong influence on survival of C. rolfsii. Populations of viable sclerotia were highest in soil in a field in which tomatoes were planted for 3 successive years before sampling and in one in which tomatoes followed groundnut in the 2 years prior to the study. Lowest sclerotial numbers were recorded in fields in which groundnut followed maize or in which maize or sorghum was the last crop before sampling (Chima Wokocha, 1988). In another study, no sclerotia were detected in fields under maize which had been under groundnut the previous year, while 3.33 sclerotia/250 ml soil were found in groundnut fields which had been under maize the previous year (Rodriguez Kabana et al., 1974). Other crop rotation studies on groundnut have shown that the incidence of C. rolfsii infection was lower in rotation with crops such as cotton or soyabean than in goundnut monoculture (Rodriguez Kabana, 1991a, b).^p^pIn pot experiments, reduction in pre- and post-emergence death of seedlings infected by C. rolfsii was given by amendments of safflower oil cake and sunn hemp, which also increased the activity of antagonistic microorganisms (Kulkarni et al., 1995). Oat straw, castor cake and neem cake consistently reduced the disease incidence of sclerotium wilt of sunflower in soil infested with C. rolfsii. Castor cake and oat straw inhibited the formation of sclerotia in soil, while rice husk and sawdust stimulated sclerotial formation (Gautam and Kolte, 1979).^p^pIn a 2-year field experiment in India, application of nitrogen significantly controlled the disease and increased root yields of beet (Thakur and Mukhopadhyay, 1972). Covering soil with polyethylene sheets controlled C. rolfsii in Phaseolus vulgaris by 71-100% in Mexico (Esqueda Valle and Zenteno Zevada, 1991). The use of black plastic mulch also reduced the severity of the disease on bell peppers (Brown et al., 1989) and in tomato (Tu et al., 1991). Piper betle cuttings planted in plots after 5 days' solarization were free from collar rot caused by C. rolfsii (Deshpande and Tiwari, 1991). Solarization for a 6-week period during the warmest months of the summer between a spring- and autumn-grown vegetable crop could provide an additional management alternative for southern blight of tomatoes in the coastal plains of North Carolina (Ristaino et al., 1991).^p^p^Host-Plant Resistance^p^pConsiderable work has been done on screening genotypes and cultivars of a range of crops for resistance to C. rolfsii. Resistance to C. rolfsii has been described for cultivars of alfalfa (Inami, 1988), groundnut (Branch, 1994), sweet potato (Jones et al., 1983) and tomato (Leeper et al., 1992). Other crops in which resistant lines have been detected include sugarbeet (Coe and O'Neill, 1983), cowpea (Nwakpa and Ikotun, 1988), finger millet (Eleusine coracana) (Tabosa et al., 1989), rice (Mathur, 1973) and wheat (Mishra et al., 1992). ^p^p^Chemical Control^p^pControl of C. rolfsii has been obtained on several crops by fungicide applications, as foliar sprays, soil drenches or seed treatment. Successful control by spray applications has been reported for tebuconazole on groundnut (Grichar, 1995) and captafol on Piper betle (Dhara et al., 1989). Quintozene, chloroneb and tridemorph applied as soil drenches gave good control of sugarbeet infection in field plots inoculated with sclerotia of C. rolfsii (Sharma et al., 1990). Other effective soil drenches include carboxin on sweet potato (Sivaprakasam and Kandaswamy, 1983) and benodanil on wheat (Hagan et al., 1991). Granular application of quintozene or flutolanil to soil controlled the disease in groundnut (Hagan et al., 1991). The insecticide chloropyrifos reduced stem rot by C. rolfsii by 17% in groundnut (Kucharek and Edmondson, 1991).^p^pFungicide seed treatments are effective for control of C. rolfsii diseases on several crops. The most commonly cited fungicides include captan (Fahim et al., 19",

  "PotentialEcoDesc": "The disease was recorded in North Carolina, USA, in 1904, and remained localized and of little importance until the late 1940s when, concurrent with the intensification of chrysanthemum flower and pot plant production, it began to cause serious losses throughout the range. It is now considered the most serious fungal disease of chrysanthemums in Florida. In 1975, in Connecticut, the disease was reported to be particularly important on chrysanthemum cuttings in propagating benches under mist; 50% losses occurred.^p^pThe increasing intensification of chrysanthemum production, with all-the-year-round cultivars, mist benches, use of dark covers, etc., favours spread and development of the disease. In addition, the fungus can develop under a wide range of conditions and, once established, is both difficult and costly to eradicate. The fact that the disease is recorded in California shows that it will persist even in areas with apparently unfavourable climatic conditions.\t",

  "Descrip": "菊花疫病是stevens, F.L.于1904年在美国北卡罗来纳州首先发现并报道的。由于此病主要侵害花部，因此对菊花生产具有很大的危害性。但在此后很长一段时间内，在美国其余各州及其他国家均未发现，直到1932年在密西西比州发生此病，随后在马里兰（1947），佛罗里达（1954），纽约（1956）也相继报道。日本（1952）也发生了菊花疫病。从1904年后40多年中，北卡罗来纳州主要是从外地调入菊花种植材料，后来随着菊花生产的发展，大量的种植材料、切花才从北卡来纳州调运、销售到其他国家与地区。显然菊花疫病也随着病区带菌的种植材料和切花而外传。1959年英格兰南部地区在从美国引进的菊花上发生此病，德国也是在从美国、荷兰、丹麦引进的插条上发生，捷克斯洛伐克1967年10月从荷兰引进菊花插条时带入此病。我国迄今未发现此病。",

  "PotentialEcoDesc": "在田间病组织上产生大量针头状的分生孢子器，尤其花瓣上更多。初呈琥珀色，后成熟变黑色，很易发现。由于病原菌丝体在叶片组织内的穿透或分生孢子释放时产生的胶状物，常使叶片卷曲，在适宜条件下，此病迅速流行，有的品种几天内可全部毁灭，重病区菊花很少收获。有时刚采下的花不显任何病状，但在运输销售过程中引起大量花瓣脱落、腐烂，以致完全失去观赏价值。",
