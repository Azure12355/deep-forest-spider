  "ManagementInfo": "Chemical Control<Br>\r\nControl of C. rolfsii has been obtained on several crops by fungicide applications, as foliar sprays, soil drenches or seed treatment. Successful control by spray applications has been reported for tebuconazole on groundnut (Grichar, 1995). Quintozene, chloroneb and tridemorph applied as soil drenches gave good control of sugarbeet infection in field plots inoculated with sclerotia of C. rolfsii (Sharma et al., 1990). Other effective soil drenches include carboxin on sweet potato (Sivaprakasam and Kandaswamy, 1983) and benodanil on wheat (Hagan et al., 1991). Granular application of quintozene or flutolanil to soil controlled the disease in groundnut (Hagan et al., 1991). The insecticide chloropyrifos reduced stem rot by C. rolfsii by 17% in groundnut (Kucharek and Edmondson, 1991).<Br>\r\nFungicide seed treatments are effective for control of C. rolfsii diseases on several crops. The most commonly cited fungicides include captan (Fahim et al., 1984), quintozene, thiram and carbendazim (Singh et al., 1982), triadimenol (Sharma et al., 1994), benomyl (Prasad et al., 1987), mancozeb (Singh et al., 1985), guazatine (Kulkarni, 1980) and oxycarboxin (Reddy et al., 1976).  Biological Control<Br>\r\nSeveral fungi have been investigated extensively as biological control agents for S. rolfsii. Application of a wheat bran preparation of Trichoderma harzianum enriched with nutrient solution at 10 g/m2, soil at the same time or 1 year after soil inoculation with C. rolfsii at 1.5 g/m2, significantly reduced sugarbeet root rot and increased yield. The same preparation retained its protective effect against C. rolfsii the following year, but a second treatment with T. harzianum increased the protective value (Ciccares et al., 1992). The mechanism of control by was investigated by examining the hyphal interactions between T. harzianum and C. rolfsii in vitro. Thin hyphal branches of T. harzianum grew towards and along those of C. rolfsii, forming several short branches and coils. Neither of these structures was formed in the absence of C. rolfsii. Penetration sites on the host hyphae were observed after removal of T. harzianum. Following penetration, granulation and vacuolation of the host hyphae occurred (Sariah-Meon, 1991).<Br>\r\nT. viride and T. koningii gave some control of C. rolfsii on barley under greenhouse conditions (Olivos and Mont, 1993) and tomato under field conditions (Ristaino et al., 1994). Gliocladium virens has shown potential for biological control of C. rolfsii on groundnut (Sreenivasaprasad and Manibhushanrao, 1993), Phaseolus vulgaris (Lewis et al., 1993) and tomato (Ristaino et al., 1994). Various vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have been examined for control of C. rolfsii in chilli (Sreenivasa et al., 1992) and wheat (Harlapur et al., 1990).  Cultural Control and Sanitary Methods<Br>\r\nCrop rotation has a strong influence on survival of C. rolfsii. Populations of viable sclerotia were highest in soil in a field in which tomatoes were planted for 3 successive years before sampling and in one in which tomatoes followed groundnut in the 2 years prior to the study. Lowest sclerotial numbers were recorded in fields in which groundnut followed maize or in which maize or sorghum was the last crop before sampling (Chima Wokocha, 1988). In another study, no sclerotia were detected in fields under maize which had been under groundnut the previous year, while 3.33 sclerotia/250 ml soil were found in groundnut fields which had been under maize the previous year (Rodriguez Kabana et al., 1974). Other crop rotation studies on groundnut have shown that the incidence of C. rolfsii infection was lower in rotation with crops such as cotton or soyabean than in goundnut monoculture (Rodriguez Kabana, 1991a, b). <Br>\r\nIn pot experiments, reduction in pre- and post-emergence death of seedlings infected by C. rolfsii was given by amendments of safflower oil cake and sunn hemp, which also increased the activity of",

  "PotentialEcoDesc": "Disease caused by C. rolfsii occurs on a broad range of crops and can be of economic importance in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. <Br>\r\nStem and pod rots caused by C. rolfsii affect groundnut in many countries, reducing yields by 10-25%. Pod yield losses may reach more than 80% in heavily infested fields (Mehan et al., 1995). A yield-loss study of groundnut in Alabama, USA, during 1983-89, showed that yield yield was increased by an average of 10.6% and disease incidence was reduced by 52.6% in plots protected by fungicide compared with untreated plots (Bowen et al., 1992). In a survey of betel gardens in different localities in India, C. rolfsii was found to be responsible for plant losses of 42-62% (Singh and Chand, 1972). <Br>\r\nIn August 1990, soyabean plants with characteristic symptoms of southern blight caused by C. rolfsii were found in south-eastern Kansas, USA; the disease affected 10-50% of plants in localized areas (Appel and Jardine, 1992). In southern regions of the USA, losses in soyabean of 20-30% have been reported, but the disease is generally considered to be minor (Aycock, 1966). The disease has been reported as a minor problem in soyabean in Zimbabwe (Smartt, 1960). <Br>\r\nCorticium rolfsii ear rot has been reported on maize only in the Himachal Pradesh region of India, and in Pakistan, where it has causes significant losses (Sharma et al., 1976, 1977).

In a survey of betel gardens in different localities in India, C. rolfsii was found to be responsible for plant losses of 42-62% (Singh and Chand, 1972). ^p^pIn August 1990, soyabean plants with characteristic symptoms of southern blight caused by C. rolfsii were found in south-eastern Kansas, USA; the disease affected 10-50% of plants in localized areas (Appel and Jardine, 1992). In southern regions of the USA, losses in soyabean of 20-30% have been reported, but the disease is generally considered to be minor (Aycock, 1966). The disease has been reported as a minor problem in soyabean in Zimbabwe (Smartt, 1960). ^p^pCorticium rolfsii ear rot has been reported on maize only in the Himachal Pradesh region of India, and in Pakistan, where it has causes significant losses Sharma et al., 1976, 1977). A sunflower disease survey in the mid-west of the USA during 1989 detected S. rolfsii wilt in 6% of surveyed fields (Gulya et al., 1991).",

  "Descrip": "Incidence^p^pAs an ear-rotting fungus, infection levels of up to 100% have been reported in maize (Sharma et al., 1977). In soyabean, it has been detected in seeds at infection levels of up to 42% (Nicholson and Sinclair, 1973; Ellis et al., 1979; Popoola and Akueshi, 1986). C. rolfsii was detected in nine out of 32 seed samples of groundnut (Mridha and Fakir, 1978). Other seeds on which the pathogen has been detected include lentil (Rajendra Prasad and Chaudhary, 1987), Phaseolus vulgaris (Akem and Dashiell, 1991), wheat (Epps et al., 1951), lettuce (Silveira, 1947), jute (Mandal, 2001), periwinkle (Ou Yang and Wu, 1998) and watermelon (Ikediugwu, 1980).^p^pC. rolfsii was reported in kernels of lodged sunflowers that had contact with infested soil, but the pathogen was not recovered from seeds from non-lodged plants (Lakshmidev et al., 1991).^p^p^Effect on Seed Quality^p^pC. rolfsii rots kernels on the ears of maize (Sharma et al., 1977).^p^p^Seed Transmission^p^pThere is no evidence for seed transmission of the pathogen.^p^p^Seed Treatments^p^pFungicide seed treatment is effective for control of C. rolfsii diseases on several crops. The most commonly cited fungicides include captan (Fahim et al., 1984), quintozene, thiram and carbendazim (Singh et al., 1982), triadimenol (Sharma et al., 1994), benomyl (Prasad et al., 1987), mancozeb (Singh et al., 1985), guazatine (Kulkarni, 1980) and oxycarboxin (Reddy et al., 1976).^p^p^Seed Health Tests^p^pCulture plate test (Popoola and Akueshi, 1986)^p^pSeeds are surface disinfected in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 3-5 min., then washed five times in sterile water and incubated on potato dextrose agar. For information regarding incubation times, refer to ISTA (1966).^p^pBlotter test (Popoola and Akueshi, 1986)^p^pSeeds are surface disinfected in 0.2% sodium hypochlorite for 3-5 min., then washed five times in sterile water before incubating on a damp blotter for 7 days at 25°C under cycles of 12 h NUV light followed by 12 h darkness.^p^pNotes on methods^p^pThe culture plate and blotter methods were used for soyabean (Popoola and Akueshi, 1986) but should also be effective for other types of seeds.",
